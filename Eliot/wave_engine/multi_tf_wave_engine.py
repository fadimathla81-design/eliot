"""
Multi-Timeframe Wave Analysis.

CHANGE LOG (this revision):
- After analyzing each timeframe, we now also compute that timeframe's
  own `direction` (via direction_utils.compute_direction) from its raw
  swings — independent of whatever pattern label it was classified as.
- Both parent_pattern AND parent_direction are passed down to the next
  (smaller) timeframe. parent_direction is what actually drives the
  "is this a correction relative to parent" logic now; parent_pattern
  is kept only for diagnostics/confidence weighting.
- This fixes the regression where a parent classified as a correction
  itself (e.g. "zigzag") was not recognized by the old
  parent_pattern == "bearish_impulse"/"bullish_impulse" check, causing
  the child timeframe to fall through to an invalid correction_start
  and return "unknown".
